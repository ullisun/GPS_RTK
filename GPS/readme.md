# Please note!
this **GPS** Folder is not part of the mower installation on mowers pi.

Copy the cpl. **GPS** Folder including subfolders, to a directory on your computer that your web browser can access. This can be on the Raspberry Pi, but it doesn't have to be. For later analysis, I recommend not installing it on the Pi.
